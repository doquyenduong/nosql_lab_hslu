# nosql_lab_hslu
An individual project for the module NoSQL Lab at HSLU. 
This is an individual project in the module NoSQL Lab at HSLU. The assignment is as follows:

# Project requirements:

* Find an "interesting" public and free dataset that can be downloaded via API.
* Import the data into your MongoDB cluster from a Python Jupyter Notebook (see Project Template).
* Model, transform and clean your data in MongoDB.
* Visualize the structure of your data and include it as image in the Jupyter Notebook.
* Conduct an in-depth analysis in Python using various MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines.
* Export the Analysis into a well structured and formatted PDF.

## Data
* Free choice what data set you want to analyze. Your goal should be to find answers to interesting questions.
* API vs Files: Pulling data via an API (e.g. iteratively in batches) or downloading a single JSON file from an URL, both is fine. As long as you download the data via script from the Jupyter Notebook and not manually.
* Format: Any public and free dataset is fine. Ideal format is JSON with nested documents (embedings). CSV is fine as well but usually does not contain nested document structures and can result in less interesting aggregation pipelines.
* Size: The dataset does not have to be big, but rather include some interesting insights you want to discover or visualize.
* IMPORTANT: The use of Kaggle datasets is not allowed, as many analysis for these datasets are already publicly available.

## Description of each file in this folder:

1. images: all pictures and images used in this project

2. Class diagram.txt: The code to draw UML class diagram

3. Marriage_and_Divorce_Quyen_Duong.html: An html version to print screen
Each version has its advantages and disadvantages

5. Marriage_and_Divorce_Quyen_Duong.ipynb: the main Jupyter notebook

6. Marriage_and_Divorce_Quyen_Duong_Final.pdf: my final version with heading numbers to help to the readers easier to follow.
There is no space under each plot on this version, so it's more suitable for my paper.
Also each section is continous, not big empty space in between. 
That's the reason I choose this as my final PDF version.
