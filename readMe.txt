Here is the description of each file in this folder:

1. images: all pictures and images used in this project

2. Class diagram.txt: The code to draw UML class diagram

3. Marriage_and_Divorce_Quyen_Duong.html: An html version to print screen
Each version has its advantages and disadvantages

5. Marriage_and_Divorce_Quyen_Duong.ipynb: the main Jupyter notebook

6. Marriage_and_Divorce_Quyen_Duong_Final.pdf: my final version with heading numbers to help to the readers easier to follow.
There is no space under each plot on this version, so it's more suitable for my paper.
Also each section is continous, not big empty space in between. 
That's the reason I choose this as my final PDF version.
